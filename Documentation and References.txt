Initial App setup :- 
Create React App
Create React App is a comfortable environment for learning React, and is the best way to start building a new single-page application in React.

It sets up your development environment so that you can use the latest JavaScript features, provides a nice developer experience, and optimizes your app for production. Youâ€™ll need to have Node >= 8.10 and npm >= 5.6 on your machine. To create a project, run:

npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start

If facing issue :- 
Step 1: $ npm cache clean --force

Step 2: Delete node_modules by $ rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json folder or delete it manually by going into the directory and right-click > delete / move to trash. Also, delete package-lock.json file too.

Step 3: npm install

To start again, $ npm start
